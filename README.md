<p>create virtual environment
<p>python install -r pip.txt
<p>add folder like image: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2549159-ce70-435a-ba21-fd5b71ba6f5e
<p>step 1 dowload dataset link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images
<p>step 2 run main.py for train. When training is successful, the .h5 file will be exported.
<p>step 3 run server.py and index.html.
<p>tips! Please test the code and let deep learning with 100-200 real and fake images for training and testing. If you let deep learning use more than 100,000 images, you don't know when it will finish learning.
